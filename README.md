### **Project Goals**

The site is aimed at people who would like to add their own recipes and also people who just want to have a browse at other peoples.

As a site owner, I would like to provide a clear, easy to navigate, eye catching site that users will enjoy visiting and find everything they are looking for. I want to give access to recipes for users to read and maybe give it a go at creating some for themselves. I would also want the user to gain access to recipes that have already been added without creating an account. By achieving this, the users would be encourages to engage with he website and add their own recipes to the database. They would achieve this be creating a private, secure account so they can upload their own recipes and gain control over content they have added by giving them the ability to update and delete any recipes they have added.

### **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to easily add my own recipes with a description of what this recipe includes.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate through the site easily and read recipes to help me decided which ones I would like to make.
- As a user, I would like to see all the recipes information without having to create an account, so I can decided if I would like to proceed with adding my own recipes.
- As a user, I would like to create a profile so that I can add my own recipes to share with others.
- As a user, I would like to search the database for a specific ingredient or recipe.
- As a user, I would like to edit or delete a recipe so that changes can be made.

## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

When choosing a font I came across a number of really good fonts to chose from on google font and also dafont just to see if they had anything that google font did not. After some testing which a variety of fonts I decided to go with …………… as this was the most eye catching and easier to read and understand. I also went with san-serif as the backup font just in case my chosen font failed.

### **Colours**

I used coolors.co to generate a colour scheme for my project. At first I was going to use black, red and white as these where mutual colours, but after scrolling through the different colour schemes, I decided to go with rich black, blue Munsell and bone as this was a better fir for my website.

### **Imagery**

The main background image for my site will be used throughout all the pages. This was carefully selected to provide eye catching site without distracting from the content on each page.  The image used fits in with the colour scheme I have chosen and allows the content the be the focus of the page. I will also add a black image overlapping the background image and change the opacity on this so that the content on the page will stand out more.

With the images attached to the recipes, I will be allowing the user to upload a link to a image which will add to the visual appeal and will make for a better user experience. I decided to make this an optional part of the add recipe section and if the user prefers to not add a image then a default image will be added in its place.


### **Wireframes**

 ##### **Home Page**
   - Web - [view]()
   - Ipad - [view]()
   - Iphone - [view]()

### **Logo**

### **Database**

I used mongodb as the database for this project, as a non relational, document database, it gives more flexibility to this type of site. I used dbdiagram.io when designing the database schema that would best facilitate this project. I based my schema on using 3 collections – ‘user’, ‘categories’ and ‘recipes’.
